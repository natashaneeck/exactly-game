## How did the Exactly game start?
In middle school, I created a verbal game with my best friend Mia called Exactly. We would pick a topic, and imagine a back-and-forth conversation with the other person. The only requirement is that the conversation had to end with both of us simultaneously saying "Exactly!"  
Once each person has finished coming up with their conversation, we would share them with each other.  

## How will the website version work?
It will function like a party game, where users can type in a join code to make private sessions with their friends. On game start, each user will be assigned another to make up a conversation with. They will type out lines of dialogue that alternate between speakers. When they believe they have finished, they press the "Exactly!" button. Once each player is done, the group will be able to scroll between the various conversations and read them aloud for laughs.
